# Cellular Automata Screensaver

Windows screen saver displaying a "Rule 30" cellular automaton.

More on cellular automata you can find on [mathworld website](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

It was my "one boring evening" project I did in somewhere in 2012 after reading a few chapters from "The New Kind of Science" by Stephen Wolfram. You can read an ebook on [official website](http://www.wolframscience.com/).
